# Gnome Shell Extension Fullscreen to Workspace

I got inspired by a feature by Elementary OS (which comes from macOS). It moves a fullscreen application to a separate workspace. This extension does just that. A lot of the code ideas come from https://github.com/rliang/gnome-shell-extension-maximize-to-workspace.

# Installation from source
git clone https://github.com/satran/fullscreenworkspace@satran.in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/fullscreenworkspace@satran.in
gnome-shell-extension-tool -e fullscreenworkspace@satran.in

# Caveats
- I have only tested it with GNOME 3.30.1
